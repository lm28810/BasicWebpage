        <p>Hello! My name is Jazmine, I am so excited to be learning how to code and to actually become a Software Engineer. My background is in Computer Networing, trust me coding and connecting wires are two different fields of IT. I decided to join this Bootcamp because I love art, and I love Technology. That may sound crazy but think about this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Art is expressive, and creative, but you can also be expressive and creative when you design apps, and websites</li>
            <li>You have to learn to draw, to paint and to code, no one is born with those skills</li>
        </ul>
